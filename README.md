## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **AI & ML Internship (Week 1)**.  
The goal is to classify **Iris flowers** into three species based on **sepal and petal measurements** using Machine Learning algorithms.  

Species included in the dataset:  
- 🌱 **Setosa**  
- 🌿 **Versicolor**  
- 🌸 **Virginica**  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔️ Understand a **basic classification problem**  
✔️ Explore & visualize the dataset  
✔️ Train models using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree**  
✔️ Evaluate model performance with **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**  
✔️ Gain **hands-on experience in Python ML**  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook)  
- `pandas`, `numpy` → Data handling  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Visualization  
- `sklearn` → Machine Learning models  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. **Load Dataset** → `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` → pandas DataFrame  
2. **Explore Data** → Summary stats, pairplots, heatmaps  
3. **Preprocess Data** → Features (X), Labels (y), `train_test_split()`  
4. **Train Models** → KNN & Decision Tree  
5. **Evaluate Models** → Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
6. **Visualize Results** → Heatmaps & charts

## 📊 Results  

| Model                  | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors | ~97%     |
| 🔹 Decision Tree       | ~100%    |

✅ Both models performed very well, with **Decision Tree achieving perfect accuracy**.
